								<p>At Scout's, I work as a cosmetologist. I cut, color, and style hair. The majority of my work focuses on fading, cutting, and styling men's hair, as well as trimming and shaping beards. I help welcome each guest into the shop and checkout guests if need be. Along with this, I focus on selling hair care products.</p>
